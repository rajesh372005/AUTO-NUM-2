>> Automorphic Number in C++ — Short Explanation
An Automorphic Number is a number whose square ends with the same number.

>> Examples:
5² = 25 → ends with 5 → Automorphic

6² = 36 → ends with 6 → Automorphic

7² = 49 → does not end with 7 → Not Automorphic

>> Logic in C++ (Short):
>> 
Take input (positive single-digit number).

Check validity: must be between 1 and 9.
